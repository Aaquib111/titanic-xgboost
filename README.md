# titanic-xgboost
Attempting to code an XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict survivors of the titanic.

The algorithm uses features such as fare cost, sex of the passenger, age, etc. to predict whether a passenger would have died (0) or survived (1) the infamous titanic disaster.

This project serves as an excuse for me to mess around with the XGBoost algorithm and hopefully to gain a better understanding of it.
